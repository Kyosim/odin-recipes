So, the current (and first!) project we're working on is a website of recipes. I'm assuming, like, cooking recipes? Just the word recipes isn't very descriptive. Well, anyway, I'll be testing my ability to create links to these recipes, which will consequently test whether I can properly set up link and image elements, along with all the standard fare we've learned so far in HTML, such as setting up the boilerplate and utilising text elements. Finally, I'll be trying to make clean, efficient commit messages for the first time with this project. Exciting stuff!
