        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h4>Spicy rice dish with an assortment of vegetables</h4>
        <p>Bibimbap might have a few more ingredients than soy marinated egg (although that's not a tall goalpost to clear!), but I promise it's just as simple to make!
            The beauty of this dish lies in its versatility. While there are a set of ingredients I'll be recommending you mix together, you can really use just about anything
            you have on hand, which is perfect for when you're desperate to clear out your fridge! A real all-rounder, this one. If you've got some rice and gochujang, you're all set~
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Rice (a bowl, if just for one person)</li>
            <li>Gochujang (red chili paste)</li>
            <li>Assorted vegetables (carrot, cucumber, beansprouts, bracken)</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
            <li>Sesame oil (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>If needed, cut any applicable vegetables, such as carrots and cucumbers. Thin slices tend to work best for this dish.</li>
            <li>Lightly oil a frying pan and fry your egg(s). Everyone has their preferences, but sunny side up is how I recommend you do it!</li>
            <li>Add rice neatly into a bowl. Arrange vegetables and egg on top as desired.</li>
            <li>Add about half a spoonful of gochujang - trust me, start small and add more if you need! You can also add a pinch of sesame oil here.</li>
            <li>Mix thoroughly before consuming. This is honestly the hardest part. Mixing can take forever, and it hurts your arms -_-</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
