        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h4>Spicy rice dish with an assortment of vegetables</h4>
        <p>Bibimbap might have a few more ingredients than soy marinated egg (although that's not a tall goalpost to clear!), but I promise it's just as simple to make!
            The beauty of this dish lies in its versatility. While there are a set of ingredients I'll be recommending you mix together, you can really use just about anything
            you have on hand, which is perfect for when you're desperate to clear out your fridge! A real all-rounder, this one. If you've got some rice and gochujang, you're all set~
