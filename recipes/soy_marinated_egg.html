        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h4>Delicious boiled eggs marinated in a savoury soy sauce broth</h4>
        <p>This is a common dish enjoyed by Koreans for its simplicity and 
            salty flavor! You can have the eggs on their own with a bowl of rice,
            or combine them with some other side dishes to your liking. Versatility
            is a real pro for this dish! As long as you have the patience to wait
            for the eggs to really soak in the soy sauce, you'll have a great meal
            ready for you anytime you're hungry.
